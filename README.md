# Telecom_Churn_Analysis

In this particular project, I am using a dataset that contains information like State, account length, international plan, Total day cells, Total day charge and using that to predict whether the customer will remain a customer in the future.
However, I firstly pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.

I tried all different classification models like Logistic, SVM,KNN,Kmeans clustering and Random Forest to check which model is best suited for the dataset
and which model yields most accurate results using different tuning parameters
